## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dorby55/Communication_LTD.git
cd Communication_LTD
```

### 2. Set Up the Backend
Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure the .env File
Create a .env file:

```bash
New-Item -Path . -Name ".env" -ItemType "File"
```
Edit the .env file using a text editor of your choice and provide your MySQL credentials:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_mysql_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DB_NAME=communication_ltd
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email_user
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_pass
EMAIL_FROM="Communication LTD <your_email_user>"
PORT=5000
```

### 4. Create and Initialize the MySQL Database
#### Option A: Using the Terminal (if mysql is available)
Make sure MySQL is running, then run this inside the backend/ folder:

```bash
Get-Content .\schema.sql | mysql -u your_mysql_username -p
```
Replace your_mysql_username with your MySQL username (e.g., root). You will be prompted for your password.

#### Option B: Using MySQL Workbench (GUI Method)
If the terminal command doesn‚Äôt work, you can import the schema manually:

Open MySQL Workbench

Click on your existing MySQL connection (e.g., Local instance MySQL)

Go to File ‚Üí Open SQL Script‚Ä¶

Select the schema.sql file in the backend folder

Click the lightning bolt icon (‚ö°) to run the script (or press Ctrl + Shift + Enter)

Refresh the Schemas panel on the left ‚Äî you should now see a schema called communication_ltd

### 5. Start the Backend Server
Run the server:

```bash
npm start
```
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

### 6. Set Up the Frontend
Open a new terminal window or tab, navigate to the location where you cloned the project(path/Communication_LTD). then run:

```bash
cd frontend\communication-ltd-frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000 or another available port.

### Testing the Application
Once both frontend and backend servers are running, open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000 ,
You can now interact with the app and test its functionality. Remember, this app is intentionally vulnerable for educational purposes.
